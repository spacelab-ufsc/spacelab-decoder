Extension Packets
=================

.. note::
   Since the extension packets are not fully implemented and documented in the original NGHam implementation, the support for this resource is not complete yet. Some extension packet are already implemented and working, and some are not implemented because of lack of information about it. In the future, a definition of these packets are planned to be done.
